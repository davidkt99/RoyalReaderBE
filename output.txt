                <p>Other than the sound of a pen scratching against paper, Han Xuhan's hut was as silent as it could be. He sat on the bedside, hovering over the small table where a stack of sheets laid in front of him. For the last ten days, he had been busy filling up these sheets.</p>
<p>Today, he had finished writing a passable manuscript for his book. Now he was busy editing it thoroughly.</p>
<p>In his previous life, he had read a huge number of cultivation novels with the harem tag attached, not to mention all those shounen animes full of harem tropes and dense protagonists. <br>What had he not seen or read in those days?</p>
<p>Using all those experiences, he wrote tirelessly, dissecting trope after trope and filling the gaps in logic with vague criticism, erudite sounding words that were too advanced for this world, explanation of human nature through psychological theories no one had ever heard of, references to unknown ancient gods like Yun Che, Ji Ning, Nie Li, Han Lin, Rito Yuuki, Shido, and Yuu Illhan...</p>
<p>The humongous amount of useless information inside his head was finally being used to its full potential. He presented arguments based on false premises and countered them with set-up logic that would confuse any gullible reader.<br>He fashioned the book in such a way that no one would be able to find any flaws in the advice and guidelines he had written, mainly because they had no idea such tropes existed.</p>
<p>He even carefully designed his words to make his source of information mysterious, just in case another transmigrator or reincarnator read the book and tracked him down. </p>
<p>He used a lot of advice to improve personal lifestyle that he had learned from the internet, something that would definitely increase the credibility of his book when applied in real life. </p>
<p>If someone criticized his book, these portions of the book could be his defense. </p>
<p>He was planning to publish the book using the sect's influence. So, during the edits, he entered some direct hints in the book to make the readers feel that sucking up to one's own sect and getting closer to their own masters was a part of the overall process of becoming a harem king, something that was bound to be approved by the sect's authorities since it would strengthen their hold over the disciples.</p>
<p>After all, which sect didn't want their disciple to have better characters and be more dependent on their sect?</p>
<p>All the advice and guidelines he wrote in there pointed towards cultivating a decent character, a praiseworthy set of morals, better behavior in daily life, and many psychological issues that dealt with the problematic attitudes of traditional cultivators, altogether leading the readers into becoming a better person.</p>
<p>And if one becomes a better person compared to their peers and stands out in a crowd due to his better nature, obviously, he would receive more admiration and adoration from the opposite gender. In the world of cultivation, looks could be made better easily with minor techniques, so character was more important!</p>
<p>Alongside such indirect and "profound" message, Xuhan dropped the multitude of harem tropes and their detailed explanations. Then he mixed it up with every cheesy flirty line he could remember from his previous life that served only to confuse and arouse the passionate hearts of young readers...</p>
<p>There were dozens of pages, full of discussion regarding dual cultivation, yin-yang integration, and similarly comprehensible, yet vague terms that gave off a "realistic" impression. Countless high-level cultivation techniques and dual cultivation methods stolen from junk novels were involved between the lines. All in all, anyone could guess that this book wasn't written on a whim to fool others. How could a mortal author imagine that much detailed information regarding high-level cultivation systems?</p>
<p>Which passionate youth was going to challenge such flawless logic when such new possibilities opened up ahead of them all of a sudden?</p>
<p>Inwardly, Han Xuhan finally realized why all the scheming villains in novels and movies laughed so dementedly every time their schemes worked, the allure was irresistible!</p>
<p>With this book, who can stop me from sweeping this sect clean?</p>
<p>Chuckling creepily, Xuhan set the pen aside, rearranged the stack of papers from his table, and walked out of his hut, his destinationâ€“ the treasury of the sect.</p>
<p>After asking around, he had learned that the treasury was in charge of managing the auctions. Since Xuhan wanted to get the sect's recognition for his book, the auction was the best bet for him at the moment.</p>
<p>The elder was available this time, according to the disciples at the gate. Han Xuhan detected a hint of displeasure and wariness in their gazes as he waited for the elder to show his face. This was to be expected. After all, one brother of theirs was still toiling in the plateau, unpaid. </p>
<p>"Hey, did any of you tell him I was lying that day?" he asked them curiously. </p>
<p>"...." Nobody answered. </p>
<p>"You should," Han Xuhan reprimanded them gently. "It'll be good for his character growth. As a junior, how can I bear to see my seniors going astray? Hopefully, he'll learn the lesson."</p>
<p><br>The elder came out of the Treasury at this moment. How could he not, after all, when he had heard that insolent scourge had come knocking on his door again? <br>Among the youngest generation of disciples, this child's appearance had been burned into his memory. <br>But it was hardly appropriate for his image to display the harsh impression he had in his heart. <br>With a kind smile, elder Shen said, "come in, come in! </p>
<p><br>"Elder, I'm not here to buy but sell!" Han Xuhan began his pitch as soon as they entered the treasury. </p>
<p>"Huh?"<br>The elder was dumbfounded. Sell? What could a mortal sell to the treasury of a sect?</p>
<p>Seeing that the elder's thoughts had slammed into a blockade in their path, Han Xuhan pulled out his manuscript and handed it to the elder.</p>
<p>"Elder Shen, I found an ancient scripture in an old cave many years ago. I modified some parts and made it into this book that I believe would be treasured by any hot-blooded male!"</p>
<p>The elder looked at the manuscript that has been thrust into his arms in a daze. The title of the book was...very eye-catching.</p>
<p>His heart lurching, the elder opened the book and started going through its contents with an odd expression.<br>As a powerful cultivator, his reading speed was quite extraordinary. Within half an hour, he finished reading the whole manuscript! </p>
<p>Han Xuhan calmly stood before him and watched as the elder finally looked up at him after completely reading the manuscript.</p>
<p>"Young man, what is your name?"</p>
<p>"This humble disciple's name is Da Dong."</p>
<p>"...Impressive pen-name you've chosen, young man. Are you interested in joining my pavilion and pursuing the great dao of the Crimson Star mountain peak? I see a great potential within you, Xiao Dong!"</p>
<p>"It's Da Dong, not Xiao Dong. May I know which dao elder Shen pursues?"</p>
<p>Han Xuhan's heart was beating so fast. This was just like those fortunate encounters that happened to protagonists! Was his luck finally about to change? Could this elder be one of those legendary cheat "grandpas"?</p>
<p>"The great dao of deceit and treachery, of course! Was that even a proper question? Couldn't you have guessed the answer already? Obviously, your potential in this dao is extraordinary!<br>That day, when you scammed someone under MY tutelage, I had nothing but derision for you! <br>But now I'm starting to see a pattern in you that I like! <br>Tell me, are you interested in becoming my apprentice and creating the legend of the greatest scammers in the world of cultivation?"</p>
<p>"...Elder Shen," Han Xuhan said with a sigh. "You seem to think that I need to PURSUE that dao. I don't, really. I don't wish to either. My apologies."</p>
<p><br>The elder's answer put out the fire in his heart cruelly. Even if it was an alluring offer, Han Xuhan didnt want to become an infamous scammer. Moreover, what if the elder was making that offer just in order to scam him? He was pursuing that dao after all...why did he get his hopes up anyway? He wasn't the protagonist, to begin with. Those fabled fated encounters wouldn't happen to him.</p>
<p>The enthusiastic elder didn't seem to mind in the slightest. With the smell of spirit stones so close, who cared about some disciple even if he had potential? If necessary, they would collaborate again!</p>
<p>This book was the very epitome of what a scammer can reach using sheer wit and literary skills! On one side, its exterior had the allure to attract countless young men with its promise and seemingly legitimate information that was extremely hard to fake. <br>On the other side, it was written so finely that even if anyone actually understood the scam, they couldn't find a way to refute it without using great influence. There were technically no lies in the book, but the premise was totally misleading! Anyone who complained against the author would find themselves in a tight position because this book vehemently supported the hierarchy and system of the sect's authority and advised the readers to love and protect their sect since filial piety to masters was a great virtue!</p>
<p>This was nothing but a money-making scheme to trap gullible young men!</p>
<p>Of course, the great number of dating advice wasn't being overlooked here, but the aged elder had been married long enough to have lost such temptations...ahem. </p>
<p>"Hahaha, disciple Xuhan, you brought it here to get the sect's endorsement so that it can receive more attention from the start right?"</p>
<p>Xuhan nodded emphatically at the elder's question, and then froze. </p>
<p>"Wait, how did you know my name?!" he said in alarm. </p>
<p>The elder didn't answer. </p>
<p>"It's decided then. We shall reveal this book after the auction ends tomorrow and encourage the audience to buy this, hahaha...."</p>
<p>His wariness brewing, Xuhan managed to work out a forty-sixty deal with the elder. Papers were not cheap in this world. The production cost set aside, Han Xuhan was intelligent enough to swallow a few disadvantages during the bartering for profit management and leave a small percentage to the elder as a "gift ".</p>
<p>Looking at his back as he returned to his own mountain peak, the elder chortled happily and clutched the manuscript in his hands with his eyes burning passionately.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, the auction would be held, and he was going to strike a fortune! </p>
